Intercepting Filter Pattern
An Intercepting Filter Pattern says that "if you want to intercept and manipulate a request and response before and after the request is processed".

Usage:
When you want centralization, common processing across requests, such as logging information about each request, compressing an outgoing response or checking the data encoding scheme of each request.
When you want pre and post processing the components which are loosely coupled with core request-handling services to facilitate which are not suitable for addition and removal.
Benefits:
It provides central control with loosely coupled handlers.
It improves reusability.
