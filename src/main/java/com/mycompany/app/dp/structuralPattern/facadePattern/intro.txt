Example of Facade DP
A Facade Pattern says that just "just provide a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, therefore it hides the complexities of the subsystem from the client".

In other words, Facade Pattern describes a higher-level interface that makes the sub-system easier to use.

Practically, every Abstract Factory is a type of Facade.

Advantage of Facade Pattern
It shields the clients from the complexities of the sub-system components.
It promotes loose coupling between subsystems and its clients.
Usage of Facade Pattern:
It is used:

When you want to provide simple interface to a complex sub-system.
When several dependencies exist between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction.
