Step 1: Create a Bank interface

Step 2: Create concrete classes that implement the Bank interface.

Step 3: Create the Loan abstract class.

Step 4: Create concrete classes that extend the Loan abstract class..

Step 5: Create an abstract class (i.e AbstractFactory) to get the factories for Bank and Loan Objects.

Step 6: Create the factory classes that inherit AbstractFactory class to generate the object of concrete class based on given information.

Step 7: Create a FactoryCreator class to get the factories by passing an information such as Bank or Loan.

Step 8: Use the FactoryCreator to get AbstractFactory in order to get factories of concrete classes by passing an information such as type.
