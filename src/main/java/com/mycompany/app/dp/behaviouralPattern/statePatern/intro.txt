State Pattern
A State Pattern says that "the class behavior changes based on its state". In State Pattern, we create objects which represent various states and a context object whose behavior varies as its state object changes.

The State Pattern is also known as Objects for States.

Benefits:
It keeps the state-specific behavior.
It makes any state transitions explicit.
Usage:
When the behavior of object depends on its state and it must be able to change its behavior at runtime according to the new state.
It is used when the operations have large, multipart conditional statements that depend on the state of an object.
